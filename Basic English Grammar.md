# *CHAPTER 3* - Using the Simple Present



## 3-1 FORM AND BASIC MEANING OF THE SIMPLE PRESENT TENSE

|            |                           SINGULAR                           |       PLURAL        |
| :--------: | :----------------------------------------------------------: | :-----------------: |
| 1st PERSON |                       **I** ***talk***                       |  **we** ***talk***  |
| 2nd PERSON |                      **you** ***talk***                      | **you** ***talk***  |
| 3rd PERSON | **she** ***talks***<br />**he** ***talks***<br />**it** ***rains*** | **they** ***talk*** |

> Notice: The verb after ***she***, ***he***, ***it*** (3rd person singular) has a final ***-s***: talk***s***.

* (a) I ***eat*** breakfast **every morning.**
* (b) Olga ***speaks*** English **every day.**
* (c) We ***sleep*** **every nigh.**
* (d) They ***go*** to the beach **every weekend.**
* (e) She ***wakes*** up **every morning** at 7:00.
* (f) He ***shaves*** **every morning.**

> The simple present tense expresses habits (習慣). In (a): Eating breakfast is a habit, a usual activity. Every morning = Monday morning, Tuesday morning, Wednesday morning, Thursday morning, Friday morning, Saturday morning, and Sunday morning.



## 3-2 USING FREQUENCY ADVERBS: *ALWAYS, USUALLY, OFTEN, SOMETIMES, SELDOM, RARELY, NEVER*

* 100% - *always*
  * (a) **Bob *always* eats** breakfast.
* 90%-99% - *usually*
  * (b) **Mary *usually* eats** breakfast.
* 75%-90% - *often*
  * (c) **They *often* watch** TV at night.
* 25%-75% - *sometimes*
  * (d) **Tom *sometimes* watches** TV.
* 5%-10% - *seldom*
  * (e) **I *seldom* watch** TV.
* 1%-10% - *rarely*
  * (f) **I *rarely* drink** milk.
* 0% - *never*
  * (g) **I *never* eat** paper.



> SUBJECT + { *always / usually / often / sometimes / seldom / rarely / never*} + VERB
>
> The words in this list are called "**frequency adverbs (頻率副詞).**" They come between the subject and the simple present verb. **\***

**\*** Some frequency adverbs can also come at the beginning or at the end of a sentence. For example:

​	***Sometimes*** I get up at seven. I ***sometimes*** get up seven. I get up at seven ***sometimes***.



## 3-3 OTHER FREQUENCY EXPRESSIONS

* (a) I drink tea {**once *a day.* / twice *a day.* / three times *a day.* / four times *a day.* / etc.**}
* (b) I see my grandparents **three times *a week.***
* (c) I see my aunt **once *a month.***
* (d) I see my cousin Sam **twice *a year.***

> We can express frequency by saying how many times someting happens.
>
> ***a day.***
>
> ***a week.***
>
> ***a month.***
>
> ***a year.***

* (e) I see my roommate ***every morning.***

  I pay my bills ***every month.***

  I see my doctor ***every year.***

> Every is singular. The noun that follows (e.g., *morning*) must be singular.
>
> INCORRECT: *every mornings*



## 3-4 USING FREQUENCY ADVERBS WITH *BE*

| SUBJECT + |  *BE* +  |                       FREQUENCY ADVERB                       |                 |

|    Tom    | ***is*** | ***always<br />usually<br />often<br />sometimes<br />seldom<br />rarely<br />never*** | late for class. |

> Frequency adverbs follow am, is, are (the simple forms of be).

| SUBJECT + |                      FREQUENCY ADVERB +                      | OTHER SIMPLE PRESENT VERBS |
| :-------: | :----------------------------------------------------------: | :------------------------: |
|    Tom    | ***always<br />usually<br />often<br />sometimes<br />seldom<br />rarely<br />never*** |     ***comes*** late.      |

> Frequency adverbs come before all simple present verbs except ***be.***

    Spelling: change ***y*** to ***i***, add ***-es.***
